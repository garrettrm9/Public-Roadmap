# Public-Roadmap

##Known issues

1. Can't update password as presently constituted
2. Follow button's active state not steady when selecting filter by follow
3. Somehow sometimes able to duplicate follow POST ... how to do unique validation for ENTIRE row, not single cell
4. Deleted votes don't re-render vote tally on FE
5. Add new feature does not re-render feature list on FE
6. Product picker icon on add feature input not working
7. Filtering features on Home screen by user follow, then switching back to sort by vote, re-renders all features but with empty vote tallies


##Later fixes

<!-- 1. Change specific "add vote" function on backend to only update votes (UPDATE: no longer relevant)-->
